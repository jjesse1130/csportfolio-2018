  <h1>How To About Me</h1>
  <p> In my about me page a created a document using various sources to help the reader learn more about me and what i like. I created this page by using html and css tags. This project was for us to make two page website explaining what we have kearned over the two weeks we have been in this class. We use various codes like p to help us write in paragraphm form. We also use h1 tags to help us create our titles for our documents. The choices i had to make were trying to put the tags in the right places so my project can come out very nice and so ican get a good grade on them. I also had to add color to make my project a little more unique and so the reader will not get bored if he sees all the wonderful colors.  The one thing ive learned is that this project requires patitence because patitnce is really required for this project. In order to mske your project come out looking nice a]you have to be patitent and use the source correctly in order to make the raider inertained.
